# Settings

As of Version 1.1.3 you can edit all settings in the new author panel of TYPEMILL. Just visit the url `yourwebsite.com/tm/login` and go to settings after the login. There you can edit:

* The system (basic settings).
* Themes (choose themes and configure it).
* Plugins (activate plugins and configure them).
* Users (create, update and delete).

All settings are stored in the `\settings` folder of TYPEMILL. It is not recommended to edit the settings manually, because it might crash the system if done wrong.

## Advanced Settings

There are some settings that are not available via the author panel. Most of them are not really useful, but if you are a developer and if you develop a theme or a plugin locally, you probably want to display a detailed error report. To do so, simply add the following line to the settings.yaml: 

````
displayErrorDetails: true
````

Don't forget to set it back to `false` before you deploy the website live. It is not secure to show the world your internal errors and many hosters will turn off all public error reports by default.
